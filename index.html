        <h2>Hiking</h2>
        <p>I love hiking, I find it really peaceful just walking through nature and looking at it.
            I think it is cool to go alone but I find way more fun to hike with friends!</p>

    <h3>Gaming</h3>
    <p>I like to game to but mostly games of the genre fps, rougelike, deck builder, rpg, and sandbox.
         My favorite being either Minecraft or Terraria I have sunk MANY hours in to both games</p>

    <h4>Activities I like to do</h4>
    <p> I like to do puzzle either with friends or by myself. I love reading because they give me so many ideas for short stories. Doomscroll.
     I like to crochet for this past halloween me and my girlfriend went as chowder and panini and I crocheted the hat and I have hand crocheted 3 blankets</p>

     <h5> Dream Accomplishment</h5>
     <p>I want to make a game is the short term goal. Even if its not played by anyone I think I would be happy.
      I want to make a game that I would spend hours on and when its completed no ones play I will be happy with the fact that I made something that I can be proud of.</p>
